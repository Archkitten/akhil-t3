## Test Prep Plans

My plans for test prep involves meeting with Ishan in Discord calls and studying the FRQs and MCs we did in class. We can also look at FRQs from past AP exams and study off of those.

Overall, I need to learn to become less reliant on IDEs, so trying to code in notepad or without VSCode extensions may help me.
